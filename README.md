# 8-Queen

The 8 Queens Puzzle is a classic chess-based problem where the objective is to place eight queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Game Features:
Interactive Chessboard: Click on any square to place a queen. Click again to remove it.

Real-time Feedback: If you attempt to place a queen in a position where it can be attacked by another queen, the move will be highlighted in red, and a message will notify you of the invalid move.

Solution Validation: Once all eight queens are placed on the board, the game checks if your solution is one of the valid configurations. If correct, a congratulatory message is displayed, and the game count increments.

Message Box: Provides real-time updates and notifications, including the number of queens left to place and any errors made.

Game Count: Tracks how many successful solutions youâ€™ve completed.

Control Buttons:

Reset: Clears the board, allowing you to start over, but only if the current board is complete or empty.
Verify: Checks if your current configuration is correct.
Exit: Closes the game.

Objective:
The goal is to find all possible configurations where eight queens can be placed on the board without threatening each other. The game uses backtracking to validate your solution against all known possible configurations.
